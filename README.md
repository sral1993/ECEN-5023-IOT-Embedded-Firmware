# Smart Industry Security & Safety with Monitoring and Management

<br>
<p> <b> Overview: </b> </p>
In this current world, time is equivalent to money. In order to save time and mitigate the human errors we are trending towards smart applications. In this project, I am going to monitor the Industry safety and security with effective energy saving management techniques. This project monitors the temperature and pressure inside the workshop and sends the data to the Bluetooth device. Workshop has an ability to save energy by automatically switching on and off the lights with respect to it’s ambience. With the help of a capacitive touch sensor, security is taken into consideration i.e., whenever it is activated it sends a signal to Bluetooth device that security is breached. Accelerometer is connected to high precision device, where any change in current position leads to a phone alert.

<b> What problem my project solves? </b> <br>
<b>Pressure Sensor: </b> <br>
Through this sensor, I monitor the Pressure condition in the Industry. If the Pressure in the Industry exceeds, it will be a serious threat and cause severe damage. So, monitoring pressure in the Industry is important in my project. <br>
<b>Temperature Sensor: </b> <br>
Through this sensor, I monitor the Temperature condition in the Industry. If the Temperature in the Workshop exceeds certain limit, I switch off and on certain applications/processes in the Workshop. Because of continuous temperature management I can save energy by not using external cooling system. <br>
<b>Ambient Light Sensor: </b> <br>
Through this sensor, I try to switch on/off lights in the workshop automatically based on the ambience present in the workshop. <br>
<b> Accelerometer Sensor: </b> <br>
This sensor is important in my application in order to find out whether a critical process is working or not. If it’s working accelerometer produces continuous change in output. If it’s not it produces zero output. <br>
<b>Capacitive touch Sensor:</b> <br>
With the help of this sensor, I will monitor security of my Industry. I have a specific touch pattern to open the doors of Industry. If any other pattern is used, I will get a phone alert. I will also switch on/off Accelerometer sensor when I’m inside the workshop.
